two sections: transient, ss
lumped cap cannot be used for whole system, but maybe used for PCR chamber
system is defined from thermistor to top of sample (plus air above sample)


QUESTIONS
can I use lumped cap with two sections?
probably model sample as lumped cap but maybe slug with heat EQ?


TRY
energy balance
    matrix of all possible values
    general assumptions
ignore spatial effects
    solve heat EQ
lumped cap derivation
